## ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Critical / Core Metrics)

| Metric                                                              | Availability in Setup                                                        | Why It’s Essential                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Implied Volatility Rank / Percentile (IVR)**                      | ✅ **Tradier**, ✅ **Yahoo Finance (via option chains)**                       | Directly measures how elevated IV is versus its historical range. High IVR is the clearest signal that IV is “peaked” and ripe for a post-earnings crush. Absolutely foundational for timing short-vol entries. |
| **Historical IV Crush Consistency (Average IV Drop Post-Earnings)** | ⚙️ *Computed manually* via Tradier + Alpha Vantage (past IV + earnings data) | Quantifies how reliably a ticker’s IV collapses post-earnings. Averages 4-8 prior cycles for statistical confidence. Critical for filtering high-probability crush candidates.                                  |
| **Implied Move vs Actual Move (Volatility Risk Premium)**           | ⚙️ *Derived from* Tradier (option IVs) + Alpha Vantage (price history)       | Compares expected vs realized volatility. Core to ensuring options are overpriced relative to realized risk—your profit engine for short spreads and iron condors.                                              |
| **Liquidity (Bid-Ask Spread, OI, Volume)**                          | ✅ **Tradier**, ✅ **Yahoo Finance**                                           | Ensures you can enter/exit efficiently. Illiquidity amplifies slippage and distorts IV readings. You already use this correctly—keep it as a gating filter.                                                     |

## ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (High-Value Enhancers)

| Metric                                                  | Availability in Setup                                                    | Why It’s Important                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Volatility Term Structure (Event IV Premium)**        | ⚙️ *Derived from* Tradier (compare near vs next expiration IVs)          | Captures how steeply front-month IV is elevated due to earnings. Confirms that IV premium is event-driven (i.e., will collapse). Excellent confirmation metric. |
| **Options Volume & Unusual Activity (Volume/OI Ratio)** | ✅ **Tradier**, ✅ **Yahoo Finance**, ✅ **Reddit (sentiment cross-check)** | Highlights tickers seeing heavy speculative positioning. Often correlates with pre-earnings IV spikes. Useful for liquidity confirmation and timing entry.      |
| **Earnings Date Proximity (0-1 day filter)**            | ✅ **Yahoo Finance**, ✅ **Alpha Vantage**, ✅ **Perplexity**               | Ensures IV is truly at its pre-event apex. Mandatory timing filter so your bot triggers at the right moment.                                                    |

## ⭐⭐⭐ (Supportive / Situational Metrics)

| Metric                                      | Availability in Setup                 | Why It’s Useful                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Underlying Beta / Historical Volatility** | ✅ **Alpha Vantage**                   | Filters out extreme movers (high beta) that may invalidate “stay in range” assumptions. Helps size spreads properly. |
| **Earnings Surprise Magnitude History**     | ✅ **Alpha Vantage (earnings API)**    | Large historical surprises can keep post-earnings IV elevated. Helps avoid names where IV doesn’t reliably collapse. |
| **Analyst Dispersion / Forecast Spread**    | ⚙️ *Inferred via* Perplexity / Gemini | Proxy for uncertainty—tight consensus implies predictable outcomes → better IV crush odds.                           |
| **Price Stability / ATR% Filter**           | ✅ **Alpha Vantage**                   | Stocks with lower ATR% tend to underperform implied moves. Reinforces your edge when selling vol.                    |

## ⭐⭐ (Optional / Contextual Metrics)

| Metric                                         | Availability in Setup                                         | Why It’s Optional                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Retail & Reddit Sentiment / Mention Volume** | ✅ **Reddit**, ✅ **Perplexity**, ⚙️ *via Gemini summarization* | Adds social layer—detects “meme-ified” names prone to outsized moves (risk control). Not core, but useful for flagging tickers to avoid or size smaller. |
| **Sector Volatility Regime**                   | ⚙️ *Derived from group averages via Alpha Vantage or Yahoo*   | Helps normalize expectations (e.g., tech vs utilities). Optional calibration metric.                                                                     |

## ⭐ (Low Priority / Experimental)

| Metric                                                                     | Availability in Setup                 | Why It’s Low Priority                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Implied Skew (Call vs Put IV differential)**                             | ⚙️ *Partially via Tradier chain data* | Interesting for directional bias but limited value for pure IV crush trades. More relevant for delta-hedged or skew-arbitrage setups. |
| **Social Media Implied Vol Proxy (via Gemini/Perplexity sentiment index)** | ⚙️ *Text-derived proxy*               | Fun to experiment with, but noisy for systematic identification. Keep as research metric, not a core signal.                          |

Would you like me to show how to **weight these metrics** numerically (e.g., scoring function from 0–100) for your candidate ranking algorithm? That would let you automatically prioritize tickers each day.
