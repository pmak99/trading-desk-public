|---------------------|:-----------:|:------------------:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| IV Rank / Percentile| ⭐⭐⭐⭐       | Yes, if logged daily| Lets you know if IV is at/near peak. Requires daily IV snapshot storage; easily added to workflow.              |

### ⭐⭐⭐ (Useful but Secondary)

| Metric                | Star Rating | Available in Setup | Essentiality & Notes                                                      |

| Volatility Skew       | ⭐⭐⭐        | Partial            | Tradier provides data; useful for extra edge/sentiment on direction. Helps weed out dangerous setups.           |
| Premium Remaining vs. Target | ⭐⭐⭐  | Yes               | Manual but straightforward. Simplifies exit rules and management.                                              |

### ⭐⭐ (Nice-to-Have, Not Critical)

| Metric                       | Star Rating | Available in Setup | Essentiality & Notes                                                      |
|------------------------------|:-----------:|:------------------:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Historical IV Crush % (by ticker)| ⭐⭐     | Manual build       | Very powerful for model calibration, but no plug-and-play API; would need to script and log over time.           |
| Reddit/Unusual Flow Signal   | ⭐⭐         | Yes                | Useful for tiebreakers or avoiding crowded trades; not primary to edge.                                         |

***

#### Key
- **Available in Setup**: Yes (can be queried/calculated), Partial (live data delayed, or manual intervention), Manual build (data exists, but requires local scripting/historical DB)

### Implementation Tip
Focus on the **⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ and ⭐⭐⭐⭐ groups** for immediate P&L impact—they are both feasible and essential for your entry/exit timing and consistent profits. Higher star = greater effect on edge and risk mitigation for your exact IV crush short spread workflow. Lower star metrics can be layered in for model improvement after the core is working well.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]
