Certainly. Based on the strategic goals outlined, here is a ranked table of the metrics, grouped by their essentialness to your IV crush strategy.

### **Metric Ranking by Strategic Essentialness**

| Star Rating | Metric | Available in Setup? | Necessity / Essentialness |
|---|---|---|---|
| ★★★★★ | **VRP Ratio (MIM / AAM)** | Yes (Calculable) | **Primary Edge.** This is the single most important metric. It directly quantifies your statistical edge by comparing what the market *expects* the move to be (MIM) versus what it *historically* has been (AAM).[1, 2, 3] |
| ★★★★★ | **Market-Implied Move (MIM)** | Yes (Calculable) | **Core Component.** This metric quantifies the market's expectation (the "fear premium") by calculating the price of the at-the-money straddle.[4, 5] It is one half of your primary edge (Metric 7) and sets the "break-even" range for your iron condor. |
| ★★★★★ | **Average Actual Move (AAM)** | Yes (Calculable) | **Core Component.** This provides the "ground truth" to compare against the MIM. It is the average of how much the stock *actually* moved post-earnings over the last 8-12 quarters.[2, 3] This is the other half of your primary edge (Metric 7). |
| ★★★★★ | **Bid-Ask Spread %** | Yes (Calculable) | **Go/No-Go Filter.** This is a non-negotiable execution filter. An iron condor has four legs, and wide spreads can completely erase your theoretical profit.[6, 7, 8] This metric prevents you from entering trades that are unprofitable from the start. |
| ★★★★★ | **Open Interest & Volume** | Yes (Direct) | **Go/No-Go Filter.** This is a critical liquidity filter. You need high open interest and volume to ensure you can enter *and* exit a 4-leg spread without significant slippage, especially during the volatile post-earnings open.[6, 9, 10] |
| ★★★★★ | **Historical IV Crush Magnitude** | No (Infeasible) | **(Theoretical) Critical.** This metric would measure the *average actual drop* in IV for this ticker after past earnings.[11, 12] While strategically critical, it is **not** feasible to calculate with your setup as it requires a daily historical database of implied volatility. |
| ★★★★☆ | **IV / HV Spread** | Yes (Calculable) | **High-Value Filter.** This is the best *feasible* substitute for IV Percentile. It confirms that the forward-looking Implied Volatility (IV) is expensive relative to the backward-looking Historical Volatility (HV), ensuring you are selling an *actual* premium.[13, 14] |
| ★★★★☆ | **Volatility Term Structure** | Yes (Calculable) | **High-Value Filter.** This is the best *feasible* proxy for the "Historical IV Crush" metric. By comparing the front-month (earnings) IV to the back-month IV, it isolates the "crushable" premium being applied *only* to the earnings event.[15, 16, 17] |
| ★★★★☆ | **Implied Volatility Percentile (IVP)** | No (Infeasible) | **(Theoretical) High-Value Filter.** This metric would provide crucial historical context by showing what percentage of the last year had a lower IV than today.[18, 19, 20] It is superior to IV Rank but is **not** feasible to calculate with your setup for the same reasons as Metric 4. |
| ★★★☆☆ | **Social Sentiment Velocity (Reddit)** | Yes (Calculable) | **Secondary Alpha.** This metric can identify tickers where retail-driven hype has irrationally inflated IV.[21] This creates a larger VRP (Metric 7) to exploit, making it a valuable secondary signal to find high-premium opportunities.[22] |
| ★★★☆☆ | **Analyst Estimate Revisions** | Partially (Calculable) | **Secondary Alpha.** This metric provides context on institutional sentiment. A high degree of analyst *dispersion* (wide range of estimates) signals high uncertainty, which helps justify a high IV. A strong *upward trend* in estimates suggests "good news" may already be priced in, supporting a range-bound thesis.[23, 24, 25] |
| ★★☆☆☆ | **Daily IV Change** (Existing) | Yes (Direct) | **Contextual.** This metric (which you already use) is useful for timing the *entry* (i.e., confirming IV is peaking) but is not a primary *selection* filter. The event-specific metrics (like Term Structure) are far more robust for identifying candidates. |
