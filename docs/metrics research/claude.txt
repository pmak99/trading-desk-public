## **Recommended Implementation Order:**

1. **First Priority:** Add the four 5-star metrics immediately
2. **Second Priority:** Implement IV/HV ratio and historical earnings moves (biggest bang for buck)
3. **Third Priority:** Add the 3-star filters to reduce false positives
4. **Fourth Priority:** Consider 2-star metrics if you have spare development time

**Note on Data Gaps:** The main gap in your setup is historical IV crush data - you'll need to start collecting and storing post-earnings IV changes to build this database. Everything else is accessible through your current APIs.
