- **4 Major Issues** identified for short-term fixes
- Recommendation: APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS

**Critical Fixes Implemented:**

1. **✅ Added Performance Thresholds to Load Tests**
   - **Issue:** Tests measured but didn't validate performance (tests pass even if 10x slower)
   - **Fix:** Added performance assertions to all 5 load tests
   - **Files:** `tests/performance/test_load.py`
   - **Thresholds Added:**
     - 10 tickers: < 0.5s
     - 50 tickers: < 2.0s
     - 100 tickers: < 4.0s
     - 30 tickers (batches): < 1.5s
     - 50 tickers (limited): < 2.5s
   - **Result:** Performance regressions now detectable ✅

2. **✅ Fixed Missing Script References**
   - **Issue:** Documentation referenced non-existent scripts (weekly_report.py, monthly_analysis.py, performance_audit.py)
   - **Fix:** Replaced with working command equivalents using Python one-liners
   - **Files:** `RUNBOOK.md` (lines 430, 446, 464)
   - **Impact:** All documentation instructions now work ✅

3. **✅ Added Systemd Service Management**
   - **Issue:** No service management configuration for production deployment
   - **Fix:** Added complete systemd service file with security hardening
   - **Files:** `DEPLOYMENT.md` (new Step 4, ~100 lines)

   - **Fix:** Replaced with specific expectations
   - **Files:** `tests/unit/test_edge_cases.py` (lines 119, 214, 373)
   - **Changes:**
     - No ATM strikes: Now expects error with specific ErrorCode
     - 0 DTE options: Now validates either success with positive move OR specific error

**Updated Rating:** 8.5/10 - Production Ready with recommendations for hardening

### IV Crush Resilience Fix - Systemd Configuration ✅ COMPLETE
**Duration:** ~30 minutes | **Files Modified:** 1 created, 1 modified | **Issue:** Systemd service misconfiguration
**Status:** 🟢 Architecture Clarification and Correct Configuration

**Issue Identified:**
- Original systemd service configuration assumed continuous service operation
- System is actually designed as one-off batch analysis (not long-running)
- Service file referenced non-existent `--file` argument in analyze.py
- Type=simple with Restart=on-failure would cause issues with oneshot execution

**Root Cause:**
- Architecture mismatch: Documentation suggested long-running service, but code implements one-off scripts
- analyze.py only processes single ticker with explicit dates (no batch processing)
- No scheduled execution capability in existing scripts

**Solution Implemented:**

1. **Created Batch Processing Script** (scripts/analyze_batch.py - 290 lines)
   - Processes multiple tickers from file with earnings calendar CSV
   - Format: `ticker,earnings_date,expiration_date`
   - Continues on error with `--continue-on-error` flag
   - Summary report with tradeable opportunities highlighted
   - Proper error handling and logging for production use

2. **Fixed Systemd Service Configuration** (DEPLOYMENT.md Step 4)
   - Changed `Type=simple` → `Type=oneshot` (correct for batch execution)
   - Removed `Restart=on-failure` and `RestartSec` (inappropriate for oneshot)
   - Updated ExecStart to use new analyze_batch.py script
   - Added prerequisites section with earnings calendar CSV setup

3. **Added Systemd Timer Configuration** (DEPLOYMENT.md Step 4)
   - Complete timer file for scheduled execution (ivcrush.timer)
   - Default schedule: Weekdays at 9:30 AM ET (after market open)
   - `Persistent=true` to catch up on missed runs
   - `RandomizedDelaySec=300` to avoid thundering herd
   - Provided alternative schedule examples (hourly, daily, etc.)

4. **Enhanced Documentation**
   - Prerequisites section with earnings calendar and tickers file setup
   - Manual testing instructions before enabling timer
   - Complete timer management commands
   - Benefits of systemd timer over cron explained

**Architecture Clarification:**
- ✅ **CORRECT:** One-off batch analysis executed on schedule (Type=oneshot + Timer)
- ❌ **INCORRECT:** Long-running service with continuous monitoring (Type=simple)

**Files Modified:**
- Created: `scripts/analyze_batch.py` (290 lines)
- Modified: `DEPLOYMENT.md` (Step 4 - Complete rewrite with timer configuration)

**Production Impact:**
- System can now be deployed correctly as scheduled batch analysis
- Timer-based execution is more robust than cron
- Proper service management with journalctl integration
- Clear separation between oneshot execution and continuous services

**Testing:**
```bash
# Verify script works
python scripts/analyze_batch.py --help

# Test manual execution
sudo systemctl start ivcrush.service
sudo journalctl -u ivcrush.service -n 50

# Verify timer schedule
sudo systemctl list-timers ivcrush.timer
```

## Next Session Instructions

### Session 2 Focus: Historical Data & Integration

**Goal:** Complete Week 1 Tier 1 metrics by implementing historical data backfill

**Priority Tasks:**
1. ✅ Implement `src/infrastructure/database/repositories/prices_repository.py`
   - Methods: save_historical_move(), get_historical_moves()
   - Full CRUD for HistoricalMove data

2. ✅ Implement `src/infrastructure/api/alpha_vantage.py`
   - get_earnings_calendar() for earnings dates
   - get_daily_prices() for historical price data
   - Rate limiting integration

3. ✅ Create `scripts/backfill.py`
   - Backfill historical earnings moves for tickers
   - Target: 100+ tickers with 12 quarters each

4. ✅ Integrate VRP calculator with historical data
   - Update analyze.py to call VRP calculator
   - End-to-end working analysis

5. ✅ Add comprehensive unit tests
   - Test ImpliedMoveCalculator with mocks
   - Test VRPCalculator with sample data
   - Target: 60%+ coverage

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Can analyze any ticker end-to-end (implied move + VRP)
- [ ] Historical data backfilled for 10+ test tickers
- [ ] All unit tests passing
- [ ] Ready for PR #1 submission

**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 hours

**Commands to Run:**
```bash
# Initialize database
cd 2.0/
python -c "from src.infrastructure.database.init_schema import init_database; from pathlib import Path; init_database(Path('data/iv_crush_v2.db'))"

# Run tests (should have some passing after Session 1)
pytest tests/unit/test_types.py -v

# Try analysis (will partially work)
python scripts/analyze.py AAPL --earnings-date 2025-01-31 --expiration 2025-02-01
```

### General Guidelines:
- Always read PROGRESS.md at session start
- Update PROGRESS.md before and after work
- Mark files as ✅ DONE when implemented and tested
- Update test counts and coverage percentages
- Note any blockers or issues discovered
- Keep PR scope focused on current week/phase

### If Blocked:
- Check .env has TRADIER_API_KEY and ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY
- Verify database path exists: `2.0/data/`
- Run: `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_types.py -v` to verify setup

## Architecture Notes

### Dependency Flow
```
CLI Scripts
    ↓
Application Layer (Services, Metrics)
    ↓
Infrastructure Layer (APIs, Cache, DB)
    ↓
Domain Layer (Types, Protocols, Errors)
```

### Key Principles
1. **Dependency Injection:** All dependencies through constructor
2. **Error Handling:** Result[T, Error] pattern, no exceptions for business logic
3. **Immutability:** Frozen dataclasses for all domain types
4. **Type Safety:** Full type hints, protocols for interfaces
5. **Testing:** Unit tests for all calculators, integration tests for workflows
